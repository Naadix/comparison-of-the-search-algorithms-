# Experimental comparison of the search algorithms of the 2nd ' grand element.
## Algorithms to compare
In this mini project, we will consider the research problem of the 2 the eme ' great element in a list
of n values. Indeed, there are several approaches to solve this problem. In our context, we `
we limit ourselves to three: 
1. Raw approach: it consists of using two variables that contain the two major values and `
it proceeds to the comparison with all the elements of the list (table).  ÃÅ
2. Divide and conquer approach.
3. Tournament approach (tournament approach).
The work required consists in comparing the three approaches. `
